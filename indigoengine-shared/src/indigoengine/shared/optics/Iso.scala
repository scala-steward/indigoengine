    * Example, `Rectangle` is isomorphic to a tuple of points, you can represent one as the other losslessly. Sometimes
    * it is convenient to modify one, by first converting it to the other, and then converting it back again. Consider
    * this example of translating (moving) a Rectangle:
    *
    * ```
    * val iso: Iso[Rectangle, (Point, Point)] =
    *   Iso(
    *     (r: Rectangle) => (r.topLeft, r.bottomRight),
    *     (t: (Point, Point)) => Rectangle.fromPoints(t._1, t._2)

    * def translate(by: Point) =
    *   (pts: (Point, Point)) => (pts._1.moveBy(by), pts._2.moveBy(by))
    *
    * iso.modify(translate(Point(20, 30)))(Rectangle(10, 10, 10, 10))
    * // Result: Rectangle(30, 40, 10, 10)
    * ```
    *
    * First the Rectangle is converted into two points, top left and bottom right, then those points are moved, and then
    * we turn it back into a Rectangle.
