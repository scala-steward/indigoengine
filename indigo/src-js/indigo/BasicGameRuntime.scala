/** Provides a no-frills cut-down Tyrian runtime for running a single Indigo game. Its goal is to be uncomplicated while
  * offering a basic useful level of functionality.
  *
  * For anything more complicated, for instance if you want specific control over the view the game is drawn into, then
  * you'll want to build your own.
  *
  * The `Model` can be anything you wish, and only exists at the level of this runtime / Tyrian app. Your game cannot
  * see it directly.
  *
  * This runtime and your game can communicate by translating `GlobalEvent <-> GlobalMsg` and vice versa, and handling
  * those messages in the respective update functions. This allows you to ask the runtime to handle side effecting
  * operations such as HTTP requests and local storage, and to send relevant data back to your game once completed.
